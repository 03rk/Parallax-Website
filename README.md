# Description 
Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on optical illusion.

I have choosen this project because parallax website creates optical illusion and fixed background so that showing amazing look .
